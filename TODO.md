# F1TV HUD Reworked - Current Progress

## Available Overlays

- Speedometer
    - Fully animated and responsive
    - Includes an automatic MPH toggle
    - Might still require some tiny tweaks for the design (will come back to it afterwards)
- Lap Timer
    - Most work done, will come back at a later time to fix some of the minor issues (and rework it a bit as well)
- Pit Timer
    - Remade in full, uses Primary Color from the game, can be overwritten in JSON
    - Only shows up when in race and when in pitlane
    - Holds the pit stop values for 6 seconds when exiting pits, then hides
- Live Speed
    - Remade in full, uses Primary Color from the game or the overwrite from JSON
    - Dynamic layout change depending on whether you use KPH or MPH as primary units in the game
    - A little bit of animation, animating the "LIVE SPEED" header and the "sponsor" logo
    - Color changes accordingly as well for speed values - RED for speed over 200 KPH and LIME when DRS is active
